They replicate this adding three harassing males during mating (calling this perimating harassment) but this appers to be a very low proportion of harassment a feal would face in nature (it ends after mating) so we don't extract these treatments because we think they severely underestimate potential harassment costs. Note: errors are given as 84CI so I extract point values using the scatter tool in the metadigitize and then transform CI to SD (see excle file in raw data folder).","Shared control and also survival and RS extracted from same pairs of treatments."
